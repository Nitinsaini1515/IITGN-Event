This project is an Expense Management System built using React (TypeScript + JSX/TSX) for the frontend. The application provides role-based dashboards for Employees, Managers, and Admins. Employees can submit expenses, Managers can approve/reject them, and Admins can view analytics and reports.

The frontend is designed with TailwindCSS for modern UI styling and responsiveness. Mock APIs and local state management have been used to simulate backend behavior (since no live backend was implemented for this version). The project structure follows a modular and scalable approach, ensuring readability and easy extension in the future.
